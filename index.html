          <p class="namestyle">Hey There! I'm Hilda.</p>
          <p>I want to build my own startup that makes a real change in the world by combining my love of technology with my skills as a business manager.<br>One of the projects I care about the most is a community health app I am making. It's the start of my journey to find real solutions that help people, especially in areas that aren't getting enough help. It has taught me a lot and helped me take a big step toward making my idea come true.</p>
          <p>Along the way, I've worked on a number of interesting projects, such as an expense tracker to help people keep track of their money, a disaster relief management system to make it easier for individuals to get help during emergencies, and an AI-powered platform to rate teachers and help students make better decisions. I also made an AI customer service system to improve the user experience by making communications easier and faster.</p>
          <p>I'm a front-end developer at Thrive Africa right now, where I'm improving my skills and helping to make tech solutions that matter. Also, I'm learning to play the trumpet in my spare time. I like being creative in both music and code.</p>
          <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Did you know I worked as a mechanic? After exploring my interests, I realized that wasn't my calling. Now, I proudly call myself an IT girl, diving into the world of technology to make an impact.</p>

      <h2>Research Abstract</h2>
      <p><strong>The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on the Growth of Small Enterprises in Africa.</strong></p>
      <p>Small enterprises play a crucial role in the economic landscape of Africa, fostering employment opportunities and innovation, even in the face of obstacles such as resource limitations, financial challenges, and restricted access to international markets. This study explores the significant impact of artificial intelligence (AI) in tackling these challenges and improving the growth and competitiveness of small businesses throughout the continent. Utilizing AI-driven tools for market analysis, customer engagement, inventory management, and financial forecasting enables small businesses to enhance their operations and refine their decision-making processes.</p>
      <p>The analysis emphasizes examples of AI-driven platforms that offer cost-effective, scalable solutions specifically designed to meet the distinct requirements of businesses in Africa. This encompasses systems for personalized customer service through chatbots, models utilizing machine learning for demand forecasting, and tools for automated financial planning that minimize reliance on manual processes. Additionally, the study investigates the potential of AI to broaden access to entrepreneurial education through the provision of virtual mentorship programs and skill-building resources.</p>
      <p>Utilizing insights from established enterprises and data, this study highlights the promise of AI in fostering an inclusive entrepreneurial ecosystem in Africa. This highlights potential avenues for decision-makers and interested parties to allocate resources towards AI infrastructure and training, enabling small enterprises to effectively leverage these technologies. This study illustrates the concrete advantages of AI integration, providing a framework for sustainable entrepreneurial development throughout Africa.</p>
